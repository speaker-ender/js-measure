# JS-Measure

### [Docs](https://js-measure.3nder.io)  

Querying the DOM can become cumbersome and unweildy 😢  
JS-Measure seeks to solve this by abstracting common queries into easy to use functions 😄  
Now you no longer have to worry about things like: 
- making sure the Window exists
- supporting legacy DOM queries
- accounting for element margins
